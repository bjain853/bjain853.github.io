                Hey üëãüèº I'm Bhavya Jain, a Software Developer and Statistician based in Canada üçÅ. Born with a natural curiosity for all things tech, I've always been drawn to the magic that happens when lines of code come to life. My educational journey at the University of Toronto equipped me with a solid foundation in Computer Science and Statistics, it was here that I honed my skills,in creating a SOLID website as well as investigating the relationship between the X's and Y's. I thrive on challenges, and I'm constantly seeking opportunities to learn, grow, and innovate be it in my work or other aspects of my life.
